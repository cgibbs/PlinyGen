PlinyGen is a lazy, half-ass attempt to write cures in the style of Pliny the Elder.

To run it, just pull down the code and run generator.py. It'll spit out a cure to an illness.

Example:

To cure Febrile seizures, combine and ingest the following:  
5 parts water  
6 parts hammered Gedrite  
7 parts coffee  
3 parts powdered Raspite  
4 parts warmed stem of the Brown daisy    
6 parts powdered Chalcopyrite
