PlinyGen is a lazy, half-ass attempt to write cures in the style of Pliny the Elder.

To run it, just pull down the code and run generator.py. It'll spit out a cure to an illness.

Example:

To cure Nonverbal learning disorder, combine and ingest the following:  
3 parts fruit juice  
2 parts powdered rind of the fruit of the Moose maple  
1 parts warmed anus of the Salmon  
6 parts sliced anklebone of the Egret  
4 parts hammered petal of the Bank cress  
3 parts hot milk of the Bass  
3 parts burnt saliva gland of the Trapdoor spider
